PHI-base is an online biological database (available at phi-base.org)
that catalogues experimentally verified pathogenicity, virulence and
effector genes from fungal, oomycete and bacterial pathogens, which
infect animal, plant, fungal and insect hosts. PHI-base aims to aid
discovery of genes in pathogens that are of medical or agronomic
importance, and which may be potential targets for chemical
intervention.

Each entry in PHI-base is curated by domain experts and is supported by
strong experimental evidence, as well as references to the literature in
which the original experiments are described. Each gene has a detailed
description of the predicted protein's function during the host
infection process. To facilitate data interoperability, we have
annotated genes using controlled vocabularies and links to external
sources (UniProt, Gene Ontology, Enzyme Commission, NCBI Taxonomy, EMBL,
PubMed and FRAC).

This PHI-base dataset is a Frictionless Data Package containing an
export of the PHI-base database in CSV format (comma-separated values).
The current version, {version}, contains information from {n_pubs}
publications, covering {n_inters} pathogen--host interactions and
{n_pgenes} pathogen genes across {n_pathogens} pathogen species and
{n_hosts} host species. Sequences for each gene in PHI-base are included
as a supplementary FASTA file.
